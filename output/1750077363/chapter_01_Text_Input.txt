They say the great typhoon of 1889 filled the air of Kii with a mythic kinda
rage. Meiji 22: The black skies cracked, and down it came. Waters rocked.
Rivers rose. That towering torii of Hongū Grand? Fell hard. The holy land
went all mush, they say, earth unstuck, undulated like the ocean. Above—
three-legged oily rascals wheeled and cawed and surveyed the slop. For
when that divine mayhem of all-penetrating wetness finally pulled back,
they say Hongū had been reduced to a slurry. Mud, mud, and more damn
mud. Shrines and homes swept halfway down the Peninsula, shattered,
floating off into a dead-still sea.
